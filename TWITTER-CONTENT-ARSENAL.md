```

### 📚 EDUCATIONAL TWEETS

4. ```
How to read DeFi risk scores:

85-100 (A): Institutional grade
70-84 (B): Solid, minor concerns
55-69 (C): Risky, do your research
40-54 (D): High risk
0-39 (F): Avoid

Free scores: protocolhealth.io
```

5. ```
5 red flags in DeFi protocols:

1. No audit ❌
2. Anon team with no track record ❌
3. >50% supply in few wallets ❌
4. Code copied from hacked protocols ❌
5. TVL dropping fast with no explanation ❌

We track all of these.
```

6. ```
Why TVL alone is misleading:

Protocol A: $1B TVL, no audit = F score
Protocol B: $100M TVL, 3 audits = A score

Which would you trust?

Check real risk → protocolhealth.io
```

### 💊 TRUTH BOMBS

7. ```
Unpopular opinion:

Most "DeFi blue chips" are one exploit away from death.

Our data shows 60% of top protocols have critical vulnerabilities.

See which ones → protocolhealth.io
```

8. ```
Your favorite influencer shilling a protocol?

Check if they mention:
- Audit status
- Token distribution  
- Team background
- Historical hacks

They don't? 🚩🚩🚩

DYOR: protocolhealth.io
```

9. ```
"DYOR" they say.

But where?
- Docs? Written by team (biased)
- Twitter? Paid shills everywhere
- Discord? Echo chamber

You need objective data.
That's why we built this.
```

### 📊 DATA DROPS

10. ```
Weekly DeFi Health Report:

✅ 12 protocols improved scores
⚠️ 8 protocols degraded
🚨 3 new protocols = HIGH RISK

Top gainer: [Protocol] +15 pts
Top loser: [Protocol] -22 pts

Full report: protocolhealth.io
```

11. ```
Correlation discovered:

100% of hacked protocols in 2024 had:
- Score below 60
- No audit in 12+ months
- Team tokens >40%

Coincidence? Check your bags.
```

12. ```
$2.3 BILLION

That's how much was lost in DeFi hacks where protocols scored <50 on our system.

Every. Single. One. Could've been avoided.

My model says it's one of these:
- [Protocol A]

- [Protocol C]

Screenshot this.
```

### 🔥 CONTROVERSY (use sparingly)

16. ```
[Popular Protocol] is overrated.

Score: 52/100
- Last audit: 2021
- Team owns 60%
- Code quality: Poor

"But muh TVL!" 

TVL ≠ Safety

Don't @ me.
```

17. ```
Thread: Why [Big Protocol] will be hacked in 2024 🧵

1/ Our AI found critical vulnerabilities...
```

18. ```
Calling it now:

[Protocol] will lose 50%+ TVL this month.

Score dropped 30 points in a week.
Whales already leaving.

Set a reminder.
```

### 💎 VALUE BOMBS

19. ```
FREE ALPHA:

These 5 protocols score A but have <$100M TVL:
1. [Protocol]
2. [Protocol]
3. [Protocol]
4. [Protocol]
5. [Protocol]

Early = opportunity
```

20. ```
Just saved someone $50k.

They were about to ape into [Protocol].
Showed them our F score.
They checked on-chain.
Didn't ape.

Protocol was hacked 6 hours later.

This is why we build.
```

### 🏗️ BUILD IN PUBLIC

21. ```
Day 7 building Protocol Health:

✅ 143 protocols scored
✅ 1,247 site visitors
✅ 89 signups
✅ First paying customer!
❌ Still can't sleep

Building the S&P of DeFi.
```

22. ```
Our scoring algorithm just caught something interesting...

[Protocol] quietly changed their multisig from 3/5 to 2/3.

Score: 73 → 61

Nobody else noticed.
We did.
```

### 🎓 TEACH

23. ```
How we calculate security scores:

Audit points (30%):
- Tier 1 auditor: 10pts
- Tier 2 auditor: 7pts  
- No audit: 0pts

+ Age bonus
+ Past exploits penalty
+ Bug bounty bonus

Simple but effective.
```

24. ```
Protip:

Never invest in a protocol that:
- Launched <30 days ago
- Has no audit
- Team holds >50%
- No bug bounty
- Anonymous team with no history

Sounds obvious?
70% of protocols fail this.
```

### 📈 SOCIAL PROOF

25. ```
"Your tool saved my ass. Was in [Protocol], saw score drop, got out. Hacked next day."

- Actual DM I received today

This is why we're building.
Every save counts.

(Hint: it's not what most think)
```

### 🎭 STORYTELLING

37. ```
Met a guy who lost $500k in Wonderland.

He said: "I trusted the TVL."

Don't be past him.
Be current him.

### 🎲 PREDICTIONS

39. ```
My Q1 2024 predictions based on scores:

🎯 [Protocol A] will 2x (undervalued A score)
⚠️ [Protocol B] will be exploited (F score)
📈 [Protocol C] will flip [Protocol D]

Screenshot this.
```

40. ```
If I had $10k to invest today:

$4k → Protocols scoring 85+ 
$3k → Protocols scoring 70-84
$2k → Stables (boring but safe)
$1k → Degen plays (score <50)

Not financial advice.
Just math.
```

### 🛡️ TRUST BUILDING

41. ```
We don't:
❌ Take money from protocols
❌ Sell your data
❌ Have hidden fees
❌ Give financial advice

We just score risk.

Transparently.
